# NOTairbnb
This repository contains my attempt at cloning the Airbnb homepage. As part of a pre-bootcamp warm-up exercise, I’m replicating the mobile version of Airbnb’s website using HTML and CSS. While the primary goal is to recreate the design, I’ll also focus on best practices, code quality, and project organization.
